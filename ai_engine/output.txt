My child, let us dive into the profound wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, specifically shloka 2.47:

**Sanskrit:** कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन
**Transliteration:** Karmaṇyevādhikāraste mā phaleṣu kadācana
**Hindi Meaning:** तुम्हारा अधिकार केवल कर्म करने में है, फल की इच्छा मत करो
**English Meaning:** You have the right to perform your duties, but not to the results.

This shloka, spoken by Lord Krishna to Arjuna, emphasizes the importance of selfless action. It reminds us that our duty is to perform our actions with dedication and devotion, without being attached to the outcome. We should not be motivated by the desire for personal gain or reward, but rather by a sense of duty and responsibility.

**Meditation Audio Prompt:** "As you breathe in, repeat 'Karmaṇyevādhikāraste'... and as you breathe out, repeat 'mā phaleṣu kadācana'. Feel the sense of detachment from the results of your actions, and focus on the present moment, performing your duties with love and devotion."

May this shloka guide you on your spiritual journey, my child, and may you find peace and liberation in the performance of your duties.
